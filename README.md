# mini-message-board

[See it in action](https://lit-reaches-01491.herokuapp.com/)

This interactive web app allows users to send and view messages.

It is a rudimentary app that helped me to learn and practice using the Javascript runtime **Node.js** , the web application framework **Express** , the templating language **EJS** , and the cloud application platform **Heroku** .

Specifically, this web application uses routes to display the main message board and the field to send a new message, managing data via GET and POST methods, and views or templates to layout the HTML of the rendered data.

I used the following resources to help me create this:

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs)
